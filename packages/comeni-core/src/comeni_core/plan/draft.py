"""A graph somebody drew, before anything has been decided about it.

**Not `PipelineIR`.** An `IREdge` carries `type_id` and `states` because the resolver computed
them from the source port while searching; an `IRNode` carries a `selection` and a `presence`
saying at which tier it was chosen. A person dragging a wire has computed nothing and chosen
nothing at any tier, and a draft carrying those fields could *disagree* with the contract it
points at — which would make the validator's first job checking the input against itself.

Four names per edge, two per node. Everything else is derived by `mendel_resolver.validate`.
